ðŸš€ Project Title
WordRace â€“ Multiplayer Typing Speed Battle

Project Scope
Our project, WordRace, is an exciting real-time multiplayer typing speed game designed to challenge players in a fast-paced digital race. The core idea is simple: type faster than your opponents and win the race. Each player sees the same prompt, and their progress is tracked in real time. The game promotes fun, competition, and improves typing speed through interactive gameplay.

We aim to build a functional, interactive, and visually engaging web app where players can:

Join or create typing rooms

Compete live with others

View real-time progress bars and speed stats

Track performance after each race

Sprint Goals / Key Milestones
Week 1: Ideation & Planning

Finalize feature list and tech stack

Design wireframes for UI

Setup GitHub repository and workflow

Week 2: Core Development

Build typing game logic

Implement real-time multiplayer with WebSocket or similar

Integrate front-end with back-end

Week 3: UI/UX & Testing

Style the game UI and add animations

Test multiplayer functionality thoroughly

Debug and optimize performance

Week 4: Final Touches & Deployment

Add user-friendly features like countdowns, sound, and result screens

Host the app using a suitable platform

Prepare for demo and feedback presentation

Roles & Responsibilities
Frontend Developer: Design and build the UI/UX using React.

Backend Developer: Build the server-side logic, multiplayer engine, and database.

Project Manager: Coordinate meetings, track progress, ensure deadlines are met

Tester/Debugger: Handle edge cases, user testing, and help improve the overall quality

Note: Roles may rotate based on availability and interest to ensure holistic learning.

Anticipated Challenges & Strategy
Real-time Sync Issues: We'll test different WebSocket libraries (like Socket.IO) and handle disconnect scenarios gracefully.

Typing Accuracy Detection: Implement string comparison algorithms to track user input in real-time with tolerance.

Latency in Multiplayer: Weâ€™ll run simulations and optimize socket communication to reduce lag.

Team Collaboration: Use tools like GitHub Projects and Discord for clear communication and task tracking.

Tech Stack (Tentative)
Frontend: React.js, TailwindCSS

Backend: Node.js, Express

Real-time Communication: Socket.IO

Deployment: Render / Vercel / Netlify
